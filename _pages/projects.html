            <h1>Project Portfolio</h1>
            <h2><a href="www.github.com/amkratz/MochaMessenger">Mocha Messenger - Java</a></h2>
              <p>A fun project, I wanted to make a program using Java to try and test myself a bit. It's a Client and Server program that can connect to each other and allow multiple clients to send messages to each other over TCP/IP. I am still working on changing the way it functions to allow for multiple clients and changing the way messages are sent.

            <h2><a href="www.github.com/amkratz/Weightlifting-Competition">Weightlifting Competition - Assembly</a></h2>
              <p>This was a project for class that I thought was very interesting. It is a simple program in Assembly that simulates a weightlifting competition and declares a winner.</p>

            <h2><a href="www.github.com/amkratz/FizzBuzz-Samples">Fizz Buzz Sample Code</a></h2>
              <p>You might want to know if I can code at all, or maybe with a specific language. These are are quick little programs I've written to just run through a common FizzBuzz Game, in multiple languages:
                <ul>
                  <li>Java</li>
                  <li>Python</li>
                  <li>More to come...</li>
                </ul>
              </p>

            <h3>More Projects</h3>
              <p>I have more projects floating around and I will be adding them as soon as I can...</p>
