## [Mocha Messenger - Java]({{ base_path }}/portfolio/mocha-messenger.md/)
A fun project, I wanted to make a program using Java to try and test myself a bit. It's a Client and Server program 
that can connect to each other and allow multiple clients to send messages to each other over TCP/IP. I am still
working on changing the way it functions to allow for multiple clients and changing the way messages are sent.

## [Weightlifting Competition - Assembly](/altPortfolio/weightlifting-competition/index.html)
This was a project for class that I thought was very interesting. It is a simple program in Assembly that simulates a 
weightlifting competition and declares a winner.

## [Fizz Buzz Sample Code](https://amkratz.github.io/altPortfolio/portfolio/fizzbizz-samples/index.html/)
You might want to know if I can code at all, or maybe with a specific language. These are are quick little programs I've
written to just run through a common FizzBuzz Game, in multiple languages:

* Java
* Python
* More to come...
