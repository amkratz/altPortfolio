[This](https://www.github.com/amkratz/Weightlifting-Competition) was a project for class that I thought was very interesting. It is a simple program in Assembly
 that simulates a weightlifting competition and declares a winner based off of the results.
 
I really enjoyed working with assembly, although primitive, it's amazing and insightful to be able to work on such a base level and directly move data and change it
in such a deliberate way. It was also very helpful in learning to code while thinking about what the hardware is actually doing with your code.
