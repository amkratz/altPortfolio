[EasyFlash](https://www.github.com/amkratz/easyflash-android-flashlight) was me trying my hand at Android development early on in 2015.
I wanted to work on an Android app, and decided on a flashlight because I was unhappy with the options I had for one on the Androird market
at that time. I wanted to make something that would simply turn the light on/off quickly, with no ads slowing anything down.
