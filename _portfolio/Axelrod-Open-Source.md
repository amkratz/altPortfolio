[Axelrod](https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod) is an incredible [Prisoner's Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma) research tool which allows users to test different strategies
against each other or in different environments. I love this project because it is quite unique in that it tries to simulate the rational decisions and strategies that humans will make and can potentially
find patterns, strengths, or weakness in them. The project is written in Python which I believe is very helpful in creating an open source project that can be easily understood and contributed to by others.
