[A fun project](https://www.github.com/amkratz/Mocha-Messenger), I wanted to make a program using Java to try and test myself a bit. It's a Client and Server program that 
can connect to each other and allow multiple clients to send messages to each other over TCP/IP.

This was an amazing learning experience for me, because it was my first time learning to send data/objects over a network and using Socket and Serversocket. Threading was also invaluable to learn, as I did not realize 
I would need it when I first started the project, but quickly realized its importance once I started having issues with blocking from different IO streams.
