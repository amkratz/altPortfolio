[A fun project](https://www.github.com/amkratz/Mocha-Messenger), I wanted to make a program using Java to try and test myself a bit. It's a Client and Server program that can connect to each other and allow multiple clients to send messages to each other over TCP/IP. I just finished the functionality using the console and initial arguments to set username and port number, but I will soon have a GUI to go along with it.
