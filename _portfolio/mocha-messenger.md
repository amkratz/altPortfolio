[A fun project](https://www.github.com/amkratz/Mocha-Messenger), I wanted to make a program using Java to try and test myself a bit. It's a Client and Server program that can connect to each other and allow multiple clients to send messages to each other over TCP/IP. I am still working on changing the way it functions to allow for multiple clients and changing the way messages are sent.
