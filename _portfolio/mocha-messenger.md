A fun project, I wanted to make a program using Java to try and test myself a bit. It's a Client and Server program that can
connect to each other and allow multiple clients to send messages to each other over TCP/IP. I am still working on changing
the way it functions to allow for multiple clients and changing the way messages are sent.
