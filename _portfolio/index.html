   <h2><a href="mocha-messenger.md">Mocha Messenger - Java</a></h2>
    <p>A fun project, I wanted to make a program using Java to try and test myself a bit. It's a Client and Server program that can connect to each other and allow multiple clients to send messages to each other over TCP/IP. I am still working on changing the way it functions to allow for multiple clients and changing the way messages are sent.

    <h2><a href="weightlifting-competition.md">Weightlifting Competition - Assembly</a></h2>
      <p>This was a project for class that I thought was very interesting. It is a simple program in Assembly that simulates a weightlifting competition and declares a winner.</p>

    <h2><a href="fizzbuzz-samples.md">Fizz Buzz Sample Code</a></h2>
      <p>You might want to know if I can code at all, or maybe with a specific language. These are are quick little programs I've written to just run through a common FizzBuzz Game, in multiple languages:
        <ul>
          <li>Java</li>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>More to come...</li>
        </ul>
