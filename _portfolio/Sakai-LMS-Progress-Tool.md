[Sakai LMS - Progress Tool](https://github.com/jmross14/sakai) is a senior project, an enhancement to the open source learning
 management system, Sakai. With a team of 5 student developers and an industry sponsor, we implemented new MVC
  components that were necessary to show instructor and student views of relevant course progress data. 
  This project was done to increase the value of the product, which in turn would allow increased client
   profits from additional support services sold for Sakai.
  
Tools used: Java Spring, MySQL, JPA, Thymeleaf, Maven, Linux
